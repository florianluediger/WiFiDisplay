# WiFiDisplay
This is the software for the ESP8266 powering my LED matrices, providing many tools for displaying various data on the display.
Currently implemented are a running text functionality and a flashing text utility.
The data is transferred over WiFi, so the display can be set up in various places with no permanent connection to a computer needed.
